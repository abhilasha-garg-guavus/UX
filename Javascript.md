# Javascript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted or JIT compiled programming language with first-class functions. Most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as node.js and Apache CouchDB. JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic scripting language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. 

JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for ... in), and source code recovery (JavaScript programs can decompile function bodies back into their source text).
